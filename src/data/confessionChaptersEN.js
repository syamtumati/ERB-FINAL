The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule
of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience.

Although the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence,
do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God,
as to leave men inexcusable, yet are they not sufficient to give that
knowledge of God and His will which is necessary unto salvation.

Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times and in divers manners
to reveal Himself, and to declare His will unto His church; and afterward,
for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more
sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of
the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same
wholly unto writing.

Which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary,
those former ways of God's revealing His will unto His people
being now ceased.

The Son of God,
the second person in the Holy Trinity,
being very and eternal God,
the brightness of the Father's glory,
of one substance and equal with Him who made the world,
who upholdeth and governeth all things He hath made,

Did,
when the fullness of time was come,
take upon Him man's nature,
with all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof,
yet without sin;
being conceived by the Holy Spirit
in the womb of the Virgin Mary,
the Holy Spirit coming down upon her,
and the power of the Most High overshadowing her;
and so was made of a woman,
of the tribe of Judah,
of the seed of Abraham and David,
according to the Scriptures;

So that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures
were inseparably joined together in one person,
without conversion, composition, or confusion;
which person is very God and very man,
yet one Christ,
the only Mediator between God and man.
