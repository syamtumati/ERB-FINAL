              Our church began in the year <strong>2014</strong>, when Peter
              Schild was sent from ERB Wetzlar to Frankfurt am Main to work on
              establishing a Reformed Baptist church. Since then, we have
              experienced how God has graciously guided us step by step and
              granted us growth. Today, we are a community of people of all
              ages, many young families with children, and people from a wide
              variety of backgrounds and life stories. We are united by the
              desire to live as a church of Jesus Christ in love for God and for
              one another, and to proclaim the Gospel in word and deed — in
              Frankfurt and beyond.

              You are warmly invited to get to know us and to follow Jesus
              Christ together with us.

                He studied Protestant theology and was sent as a missionary to
                Frankfurt in 2014 to establish a Reformed Baptist church. In
                addition to his pastoral ministry, he is the author of several
