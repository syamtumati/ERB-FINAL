        <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
        <p>
          As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these
          pages in accordance with general laws. However, we are not obligated to
          monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
          circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general
          laws remain unaffected. Liability in this regard is only possible from
          the point in time at which a specific infringement becomes known. Upon
          becoming aware of such legal violations, we will remove the content
          immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
        <p>
          Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose
          content we have no control. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
          for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
          linked pages is always responsible for their content.
        </p>

        <p>
          The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the
          time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of
          linking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not
          reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. If we
          become aware of any violations, such links will be removed immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Copyright</h2>
        <p>
          The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are
          subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution,
          or any form of commercialization beyond the scope of copyright law
          requires the prior written consent of the respective author or creator.
        </p>

        <p>
          Downloads and copies of this site are permitted for private,
          non-commercial use only.
        </p>

        <p>
          Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator,
          the copyrights of third parties are respected. Should you nevertheless
          become aware of a copyright infringement, please notify us. Upon
          becoming aware of such violations, we will remove the content
          immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
          When accessing our website, general information is automatically
          collected (so-called server log files). This includes, among other
          things, the web browser used, the operating system, and the Internet
          service provider. This data does not allow any conclusions to be drawn
          about your person.
        </p>

        <p>
          The use of our website is generally possible without providing
          personal data. Where personal data is collected, this is done on a
          voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties
          without your explicit consent.
        </p>

        <p>
          We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. email
          communication) can have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection
          of data against access by third parties is not possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          The use of contact data published within the scope of the legal notice
          obligation by third parties for the transmission of unsolicited
          advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited.
